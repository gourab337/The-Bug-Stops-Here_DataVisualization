# The-Bug-Stops-Here_DataVisualization
We have done the data visualization problem of displaying the time series data of the value of currencies of different countries with respect to USD.
For this problem, we have used two methods.
1. Python

As you might know, python is one of the most famous languages and probably the best when it comes to development, data science and AI.
First we wrangled the data, made it more proper for analaysis and displaying the graph. This has been done using the pandas library of python.
We made a separate excel sheet for every country using python pandas.
Next we used the matplotlib library for visualizing data in the form of graphs.
Graphs for a single country and comparison graphs(between two or more countries) have been coded.


2. Tableau

Tableau is the best software out there when it comes to data visualization. It is being used by the top companies(proven by stats).
So we have displayed the current data in a unique graph and also the line graph of the data for india which also displays the values for other countries.
We didn't display many line graphs together as the graphs were clustering(the data was for everyday from 2000 to 2019 so).
Also, you can see the trend line in the line graph shown in tableau.


Thank you for this hackathon, it was fun coding at night for a hackathon.
